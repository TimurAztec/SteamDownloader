## Tech part üë®‚Äçüíª
This app runs on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) using [NodeGui](https://docs.nodegui.org/)

Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
<br/>
Download and install [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)
<br/>
(Optionaly) Download and install [Qt](https://nodejs.org/)
<br/>
Clone repository

```
And it's gonna be inside deploy folder.

### In case of build errors try to follow this [Guideline](https://nodejs.org/)
